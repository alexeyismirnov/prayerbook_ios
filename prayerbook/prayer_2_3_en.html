<p class="rubric">Before commencing any rule of prayer, and at its completion, the following
reverences are made (prostrations or bows), called "The Seven Bow Beginning."

</p><p>O God, be merciful to me, a sinner. <span class="rubric">(bow)</span>

</p><p>O God, cleanse me, a sinner, and have mercy on me. <span class="rubric">(bow)</span>

</p><p>Having created me, O Lord, have mercy on me. <span class="rubric">(bow)</span>

</p><p>I have sinned immeasurably, O Lord, forgive me. <span class="rubric">(bow)</span>

</p><p>My sovereign, most holy Mother of God, save me, a sinner, <span class="rubric">(bow)</span>

</p><p>O Angel, my holy Guardian, protect me from all evil. <span class="rubric">(bow)</span>

</p><p>Holy Apostle <span class="rubric">(or martyr, or holy father Name)</span> pray to God for me. <span class="rubric">(bow)</span>

</p><p>Then: Through the prayers of our holy fathers, O Lord Jesus Christ,
our God, have mercy on us. Amen.

</p><p>Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee.

</p><p>Heavenly King… to Our Father… (See Morning Prayers)

</p><p>Lord, have mercy. <span class="rubric">(12)</span>

</p><p>Glory… Now …

</p><p>O come, let us worship …

</p>
<span class="rubric">
    <p>Psalm 50.
    
    </p><p>The Symbol of Faith.
    
    </p><p>Then the Canons and Akathists are read as follows:
    
    </p><p>A) If one Canon or Akathist is to be read it is read straight through.
    
    </p><p>B) If more than one Canon is to be read, the first Song of the first
    Canon is read. If the Refrain before the final or last two Troparia is
    Glory… Now … , it is replaced by the Refrain of the Canon and "Most
    Holy Mother of God, save us" (the latter comes before a Troparion to the
    Virgin). The first Song of the second Canon is read, beginning with the
    Refrain (the Eirmios of the first Canon only is read), etc. Glory… and
    Now… are used only as Refrains before the last two Troparia (or last
    Troparion) of the final Canon to be read. Then the third Song of the first
    Canon, beginning with the Eirmos, etc. After the third Song: Lord have
    mercy (3), Glory… Now… Sedalions. When there are more than one Canon,
    the Kontakion(s) of the second and any additional ones are read after the
    Sedalions. Glory… Now… is read before the final verses. Then Songs
    4, 5 and 6 are read. After Song 6: Lord, have mercy. (3), Glory… Now … Kontakion of
    the first Canon. Then Songs 7, 8 and 9 are read.
    
    </p><p>C) If an Akathist is read with the Canon (s), it is included after Song
    6. All Kontakions of the Canon (s) are read after Song 3 in this case.
    
    </p><p>After Song 9:
    
    </p>
</span>
<p>It is meet and right… <span class="rubric">(See p. 36)</span>
<br>Trisagion to Our Father …

</p><p>Have mercy on us… <span class="rubric">and the rest of the Prayers Before Sleep</span>.

</p><p class="rubric">If no other prayers are to be read, the closing is as follows:

</p><p>It is meet and right…

</p><p>Prayer(s) following the Canon (s).

</p><p>Trisagion to Our Father…

</p><p>Lord, have mercy. <span class="rubric">(3)</span>

</p><p>Glory… Now…

</p><p>More Honourable than the Cherubim…

</p><p>Through the prayers of our holy fathers, O Lord Jesus Christ, our God,
have mercy on us. Amen.

</p><p class="rubric">Those who are preparing for Holy Communion are obliged to read three
Canons and one Akathist the evening before. Usually read are the Canons
to the Saviour, the Mother of God, and the Guardian Angel (in that order),
and either an Akathist to the Saviour or to the Mother of God. Those who
desire to carry out this evening rule of prayer daily receive great spiritual
benefit from doing so.
