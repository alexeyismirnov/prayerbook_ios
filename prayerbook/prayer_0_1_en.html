<h1> Prayer 1, of St. Macarius the Great to God the Father </h1>



O Eternal God and King of all creation, Who hast granted me to arrive at this hour, forgive me the sins that I have committed today in thought, word and deed, and cleanse, O Lord, my humble soul from all defilement of flesh and spirit. And grant me, O Lord, to pass the sleep of this night in peace, that when I rise from my bed I may please Thy most holy Name all the days of my life and conquer my flesh and the fleshless foes that war with me. And deliver me, O Lord, from vain and frivolous thoughts, and from evil desires which defile me. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.


<h1> Prayer 2, of St. Antioch to our Lord Jesus Christ </h1>



O All-Ruler, Word of the Father, Jesus Christ, Thou Who art perfect, never in Thy great mercy leave me, but ever abide in me, Thy servant. O Jesus, Good Shepherd of Thy sheep, deliver me not to the revolt of the serpent and leave me not to the will of satan, for the seed of corruption is in me. Lord, adorable God, Holy King, Jesus Christ, guard me asleep by the unwaning light, Thy Holy Spirit, by Whom Thou didst sanctify Thy disciples. O Lord, grant me, Thy unworthy servant, Thy salvation on my bed. Enlighten my mind with the light of understanding of Thy Holy Gospel. Enlighten my soul with the love of Thy Cross. Enlighten my heart with the purity of Thy Word. Enlighten my body with Thy passionless Passion. Keep my thoughts in Thy humility. And rouse me in good time to glorify Thee, for Thou art supremely glorified, with Thy eternal Father, and Thy most Holy Spirit forever. Amen.


<h1> Prayer 3, of St. Ephrem the Syrian to the Most Holy Spirit </h1>



O Lord, Heavenly King, Comforter, Spirit of Truth, have compassion and mercy on Thy sinful servant and pardon my unworthiness, and forgive me all the sins that I humanly committed today, and not only humanly but even worse than a beast - my voluntary sins, known and unknown, from my youth and from evil suggestions, and from my brazenness, and from boredom. If I have sworn by Thy Name or blasphemed it in thought, blamed or reproached anyone, or in my anger have detracted or slandered anyone, or grieved anyone, or if I have got angry about anything, or have told a lie, if I have slept unnecessarily, or if a beggar has come to me and I despised or neglected him, or if I have troubled my brother or quarrelled with him, or if I have condemned anyone, or have boasted, or have been proud, or lost my temper with anyone, or if when standing in prayer my mind has been distracted by the glamour of this world, or if I have had depraved thoughts or have overeaten, or have drunk excessively, or have laughed frivolously, or have thought evil, or have seen the attraction of someone and been wounded by it in my heart, or said indecent things, or made fun of my brother's sin when my own faults are countless, or been neglectful of prayer, or have done some other wrong that I cannot remember - for I have done all this and much more - have mercy, my Lord and Creator, on me Thy wretched and unworthy servant, and absolve and forgive and deliver me in Thy goodness and love for men, so that, lustful, sinful and wretched as I am, I may lie down and sleep and rest in peace. And I shall worship, praise and glorify Thy most honourable Name, with the Father and His only-begotten Son, now and ever, and for all ages. Amen.


<h1> Prayer 4, of St. Macarius the Great </h1>



What shall I offer Thee, or what shall I give Thee, O greatly-gifted, immortal King, O compassionate Lord Who lovest mankind? For though I have been slothful in pleasing Thee, and have done nothing good, Thou hast led me to the close of this day that is past, establishing the conversion and salvation of my soul. Be merciful to me a sinner, bereft of every good deed, raise up my fallen soul which hath become defiled by countless sins, and take away from me every evil thought of this visible life. Forgive my sins, O Only Sinless One, in which I have sinned against Thee this day, known or unknown, in word, and deed, and thought, and in all my senses. Do Thou Thyself protect and guard me from every opposing circumstance, by Thy Divine authority and power and inexpressible love for mankind. Blot out, O God, blot out the multitude of my sins. Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me from the net of the evil one, and save my passionate soul, and overshadow me with the light of Thy countenance when Thou shalt come in glory; and cause me, uncondemned now, to sleep a dreamless sleep, and keep Thy servant untroubled by thoughts, and drive away from me all satanic deeds; and enlighten for me the eyes of my heart with understanding, lest I sleep unto death. And send me an angel of peace, a guardian and guide of my soul and body, that he may deliver me from mine enemies; that, rising from my bed, I may offer Thee prayers of thanksgiving. Yea, O Lord, hearken unto me, Thy sinful and wretched servant, in confession and conscience; grant me, when I arise, to be instructed by Thy sayings; and through Thine angels cause demonic despondency to be driven far from me: that I may bless Thy holy name, and glorify and extol the most pure Theotokos Mary, whom Thou hast given to us sinners as a protectress, and accept her who prayeth for us. For I know that she exemplifieth Thy love for mankind and prayeth for us without ceasing. Through her protection, and the sign of the precious Cross, and for the sake of all Thy saints, preserve my wre tched soul, O Jesus Christ our God: for holy art Thou, and most glorious forever. Amen.


<h1>Prayer 5</h1>


O Lord, our God, in Thy goodness and love for men forgive me all the sins I have committed today in word, deed or thought. Grant me peaceful and undisturbed sleep. Send Thy Guardian Angel to guard and protect me from all evil. For Thou art the guardian of our souls and bodies, and to Thee we ascribe glory, to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.


<h1>Prayer 6</h1>



O Lord our God, in Whom we believe and Whose Name we invoke above every name, grant us preparing for sleep relaxation of soul and body, and keep us from all temptations and dark pleasures. Stop the rushing of passions, and quench the burning of bodily tensions. Grant us to live chastely in word and act, that we may live a life of heroic virtue and not fall away from Thy promised blessings. For Thou art blessed for ever. Amen.

    Name. Lord Jesus Christ, write me Thy servant in the Book of Life, and
    grant me a good end. O Lord my God, even though I have done nothing good

    wilt; may Thy will be also in me, a sinner, for blessed art Thou for ever.

<h1> Prayer 8, our Lord Jesus Christ </h1>



O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, for the sake of Thy most honourable Mother, Thy fleshless Angels, Thy Prophet and Forerunner and Baptizer, all the God-inspired Apostles, the radiant and victorious Martyrs, the holy and God-bearing Fathers, and by the prayers of all Saints, deliver me from the besetting presence of the devil. My Lord and Creator, Who desirest not the death of the sinner, but that he should be converted and live, grant also conversion to me, wretched and unworthy, snatch me from the jaws of the pernicious serpent, who is ravening to devour me and drag me down to hell alive. My Lord, my Comfort, Who wast clothed in corruptible flesh for my miserable sake, deliver me from misery and grant comfort to my miserable soul. Implant in my heart to fulfil Thy commandments, and forsake my evil deeds, and to receive Thy joys. Save me, for I hope in Thee, O Lord. Amen.


<h1> Prayer 9, to the Most Holy Theotokos, by Peter, the Studite monk </h1>

Before you, the Most Pure Mother of God, I who am wretched fall down and pray: you know, O Queen that I sin constantly and anger your Son and my God. No matter how often I repent, I appear a liar before God, and repent with trembling. Can God shake me and I do those same things again an hour later? Knowing this, my Mistress, O Lady Theotokos, I pray: have mercy on me , strengthen me and grant that I may do good. You know, my Lady Theotokos, that I abhor my evil deeds and love the law of my God with all my mind. But, most pure Lady, I do not know how I can love what I abhor and turn away from what is good. Do not allow my will to be done, Most Pure One, for it is not appropriate. May the will of your Son and my God be done. May He save and enlighten me, and give me the Grace of His Holy Spirit, in order that I might stop sinning from this time on and live the remainder of my life in obedience to your Son, to Whom belongs all glory, honor and majesty, with His Father Who is without beginning, and His Most Holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.

<h1>Prayer 11, of Intercession to the holy Guardian Angel</h1>


O Angel of Christ, my holy Guardian and Protector of my soul and body, forgive me all my sins of today. Deliver me from all the wiles of the enemy, that I may not anger my God by any sin. Pray for me, sinful and unworthy servant, that thou mayest present me worthy of the kindness and mercy of the All-holy Trinity and the Mother of my Lord Jesus Christ, and of all the Saints. Amen.


<h1> Prayer 12, (Here one says a prayer to one's Patron Saint.)  </h1>

<h1> Prayer of St. John of Damascus </h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p class="rubric">(To be said pointing at the bed.)</p>
    
    
    <p>O Lord, Lover of men, is this bed to be my coffin, or wilt Thou enlighten
    my wretched soul with another day? Here the coffin lies before me, and
    here death confronts me. I fear, O Lord, Thy Judgment and the endless torments,
    yet I cease not to do evil.
    My Lord God, I continually anger Thee, and Thy immaculate Mother, and
    all the Heavenly Powers, and my holy Guardian Angel. I know, O Lord, that
    I am unworthy of Thy love, but deserve condemnation and every torment.
    But, whether I want it or not, save me, O Lord. For to save a good man
    is no great thing, and to have mercy on the pure is nothing wonderful,
    for they are worthy of Thy mercy. But show the wonder of Thy mercy on me,
    a sinner. In this reveal Thy love for men, lest my wickedness prevail over
    Thy unutterable goodness and mercy. And order my life as Thou wilt.
