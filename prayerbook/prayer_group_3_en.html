<h1>Kontakion 1</h1>



Warrior-Chieftain and Lord, Vanquisher of hell, I Thy creature and servant offer Thee songs of praise, for Thou hast delivered me from eternal death. But as Thou hast unutterable loving-kindness, free me from every danger, as I cry: Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me.

<h1>Oikos 1</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>Creator of Angels and Lord of Hosts! As of old Thou didst open ear and
    tongue to the deaf and dumb, likewise open now my perplexed mind and tongue
    to the praise of Thy Most Holy Name, that I may cry to Thee:</p>
    <p> Jesus All-Wonderful,
    Angels' Astonishment! Jesus All-Powerful, Forefathers' Deliverance!
    Jesus All-Sweetest, Patriarchs' Exaltation! Jesus All-Glorious, Kings'
    Stronghold! Jesus All-Beloved, Prophets' Fulfillment! Jesus
    All-Marvellous, Martyrs' Strength! Jesus All-Peaceful, Monks'
    Joy! Jesus All-Gracious, Presbyters' Sweetness! Jesus
    All-Merciful, Fasters' Abstinence! Jesus All-Tenderest, Saints' Rejoicing!

<h1> Kontakion 2</h1>



As when seeing the widow weeping bitterly, O Lord, Thou wast moved with pity, and didst raise her son from the dead as he was being carried to burial, likewise have pity on me, O Lover of men, and raise my soul, deadened by sins, as I cry, Alleluia!


<h1>Oikos 2</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>Seeking to know what passes knowledge, Philip asked: "Lord, show us
    the Father"; and Thou didst answer him: "Have I been so long with you and
    yet hast thou not known that I am in the Father and the Father in Me?"
    Likewise, O Inconceivable One, with fear I cry to Thee:</p>
    <p> Jesus, Eternal God! Jesus, All-Powerful King!
    Jesus, Long-suffering Master! Jesus, All-Merciful Saviour! Jesus, my gracious
    Guardian! Jesus, cleanse my sins! Jesus, take away my iniquities! Jesus,
    pardon my unrighteousness! Jesus, my Hope, forsake me not! Jesus, my Helper,
    reject me not! Jesus, my Creator, forget me not! Jesus, my Shepherd, lose
    me not! Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me!

<h1>Kontakion 3</h1>



Thou Who didst endue with power from on high Thy Apostles who tarried in Jerusalem, O Jesus, clothe also me, stripped bare of all good work, with the warmth of Thy Holy Spirit, and grant that with love I may sing to Thee: Alleluia!


<h1>Oikos 3</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>In the abundance of Thy mercy, O Jesus, Thou hast called publicans and
    sinners and infidels. Now despise me not who am like them, but as precious myrrh accept this song:</p>
    <p> Jesus, Invincible Power! Jesus, Infinite Mercy! Jesus, Radiant Beauty! Jesus,
    Unspeakable Love! Jesus, Son of the Living God! Jesus, have mercy on me,
    a sinner! Jesus, hear me who was conceived in iniquity! Jesus, cleanse
    me who was born in sin! Jesus, teach me who am worthless! Jesus, enlighten
    my darkness! Jesus, purify me who am unclean! Jesus, restore me, a prodigal! Jesus,
    Son of God, have mercy on me!
    </p>

<h1>Kontakion 4</h1>




Having an interior storm of doubting thoughts, Peter was sinking. But beholding Thee, O Jesus, in the flesh walking on the waters, he confessed Thee to be the true God; and receiving the hand of salvation, he cried: Alleluia!


<h1>Oikos 4</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>When the blind man heard Thee, O Lord, passing by on the way, he cried:
    Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me! And Thou didst call him and open
    his eyes. Likewise enlighten the spiritual eyes of my heart with Thy love
    as I cry to Thee and say:</p>
    <p> Jesus, Creator of those on high! Jesus, Redeemer
    of those below! Jesus, Vanquisher of the powers of hell! Jesus, Adorner
    of every creature! Jesus, Comforter of my soul! Jesus, Enlightener of my
    mind! Jesus, Gladness of my heart! Jesus, Health of my body!

    me from all torments! Jesus, save me despite my unworthiness! Jesus, Son

<h1>Kontakion 5</h1>



As of old Thou didst redeem us from the curse of the law by Thy Divinely-shed Blood, O Jesus, likewise rescue me from the snares in which the serpent has entangled us through the passions of the flesh, through lustful suggestions and evil despondency, as we cry to Thee: Alleluia!


<h1>Oikos 5</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>Seeing the Creator in human form and knowing Him to be their Lord, the
    Hebrew children sought to please Him with branches, crying: Hosanna! But
    we offer Thee a song, saying:</p>
    <p> Jesus, True God! Jesus, Son of David! Jesus,
    Glorious King! Jesus, Innocent Lamb! Jesus, Wonderful Shepherd! Jesus,
    Guardian of my infancy! Jesus, Nourisher of my youth! Jesus, Praise of
    my old age! Jesus, my Hope at death! Jesus, my Life after death! Jesus,
    my Comfort at Thy Judgment! Jesus, my Desire, let me not then be ashamed.
    Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me!

<h1>Kontakion 6</h1>



In fulfillment of the words and message of the inspired Prophets, O Jesus, Thou didst appear on earth, and Thou Who art uncontainable didst dwell with men. Thenceforth, being healed through Thy wounds, we learned to sing: Alleluia!


<h1>Oikos 6</h1>
<div class="colright">
    <p>When the light of Thy truth dawned on the world, devilish delusion was
    driven away; for the idols, O our Saviour, have fallen, unable to endure
    Thy strength. But we who have received salvation, cry to Thee:</p>
    <p> Jesus, the
    Truth, dispelling falsehood! Jesus, the Light above all lights! Jesus,
    the King, surpassing all in strength! Jesus, God, constant in mercy! Jesus,
    Bread of Life, fill me who am hungry! Jesus, Source of Knowledge, refresh
    me who am thirsty! Jesus, Garment of Gladness, clothe my nakedness!
    Jesus, Veil of Joy, cover my unworthiness! Jesus, Giver to those who
    ask, give me sorrow for my sins! Jesus, Finder of those who seek, find
    my soul! Jesus, Opener to those who knock, open my wretched heart! Jesus,
    Redeemer of sinners, wash away my sins! Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on
    me!
    </p>

<h1>Kontakion 7</h1>



Desiring to unveil the mystery hidden from all ages, Thou wast led as a sheep to the slaughter, O Jesus, and as a lamb before its shearer. But as God Thou didst rise from the dead and didst ascend with glory to Heaven, and along with Thyself Thou didst raise us who cry: Alleluia!


<h1>Oikos 7</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>The Creator has shown us a marvelous Creature, Who took flesh without
    seed from a Virgin, rose from the tomb without breaking the seal, and entered
    bodily the Apostles' room when the doors were shut. Therefore, marvelling
    at this we sing:</p>
    <p> Jesus, Uncontainable Word! Jesus, Inscrutable Intelligence!
    Jesus, Incomprehensible Power! Jesus, Inconceivable Wisdom! Jesus, Undepictable
    Deity! Jesus, Boundless Dominion! Jesus, Invincible Kingdom! Jesus, Unending
    Sovereignty! Jesus, Supreme Strength! Jesus, Eternal Power! Jesus, my Creator,
    have compassion on me! Jesus, my Saviour, save me! Jesus, Son of God, have
    mercy on me!

<h1>Kontakion 8</h1>



Seeing God wondrously incarnate, let us shun the vain world and set our mind on things divine; for God descended to earth to raise to Heaven us who cry to Him: Alleluia!


<h1> Oikos 8</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>Being both below and above, Thou didst never falter, O Thou immeasurable
    One, when Thou didst voluntarily suffer for us, and by Thy death our death
    didst put to death, and by Thy Resurrection didst grant life to those who
    sing:</p>
    <p> Jesus, Sweetness of the heart! Jesus, Strength of the body! Jesus,
    Purity of the soul! Jesus, Brightness of the mind! Jesus, Gladness of the
    conscience! Jesus, Sure Hope! Jesus, Memory Eternal! Jesus, High Praise!
    Jesus, my most exalted Glory! Jesus, my Desire, reject me not! Jesus, my
    Shepherd, recover me! Jesus, my Saviour, save me! Jesus, Son of God, have
    mercy on me!

<h1>Kontakion 9</h1>



The Angelic Hosts in Heaven glorify unceasingly Thy most holy Name, O Jesus, crying: Holy, Holy, Holy! But we sinners on earth, with our frail voices cry: Alleluia!


<h1>Oikos 9</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>We see most eloquent orators voiceless as fish when they must speak
    of Thee, O Jesus our Saviour. For it is beyond their power to tell how
    Thou art both perfect man and immutable God at the same time. But we, marvelling
    at this Mystery, cry faithfully:</p>
    <p> Jesus, Eternal God! Jesus, King of Kings!
    Jesus, Lord of Lords! Jesus, Judge of the living and the dead! Jesus, Hope
    of the hopeless! Jesus, Comforter of the mournful! Jesus, Glory of the
    poor! Jesus, condemn me not according to my deeds!
    Jesus, cleanse me according to Thy mercy! Jesus, take from me despondency!
    Jesus, enlighten the thoughts of my heart! Jesus, make me ever mindful
    of death! Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me!
    </p>
</div>

<h1>Kontakion 10</h1>



Wishing to save the world, O Sunrise of the East, Thou didst come to the dark Occident of our nature, and didst humble Thyself even to the point of death. Therefore Thy Name is exalted above every name, and from all the tribes of earth and heaven, Thou dost hear: Alleluia!


<h1>Oikos 10</h1>

<div class="colright">
    
    <p>King Eternal, Comforter, true Christ! Cleanse us from every stain as
    Thou didst cleanse the Ten Lepers, and heal us as Thou didst heal the greedy
    soul of Zacchaeus the publican, that we may cry to Thee with compunction
    and say:</p>
    <p> Jesus, Treasurer Incorruptible! Jesus, Unfailing Wealth! Jesus,
    Strong Food! Jesus, Inexhaustible Drink! Jesus, Garment of the poor! Jesus,
    Defender of widows! Jesus, Protector of orphans! Jesus, Helper of toilers!
    Jesus, Guide of pilgrims! Jesus, Pilot of voyagers!
    Jesus, Calmer of tempests! Jesus, raise me who am fallen! Jesus, Son
    of God, have mercy on me!

<h1>Kontakion 11</h1>



Tenderest songs I, though unworthy, offer to Thee, and like the woman of Canaan, I cry to Thee: O Jesus, have mercy on me! For it is not my daughter, but my flesh violently possessed with passions and burning with fury. So grant healing to me, who cry to Thee: Alleluia!


<h1>Oikos 11</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>Having previously persecuted Thee Who art the Light that enlightens
    those who are in the darkness of ignorance, Paul experienced the power
    of the voice of divine enlightenment, and understood the swiftness of the
    soul's conversion to God. Likewise, enlighten the dark eye of my soul,
    as I cry:</p>
    <p> Jesus, my All-powerful King! Jesus, my Almighty God! Jesus, my
    Immortal Lord! Jesus, my most glorious Creator! Jesus, my most kind Teacher
    and Guide! Jesus, my most compassionate Shepherd! Jesus, my most gracious
    Master! Jesus, my most merciful Saviour! Jesus, enlighten my senses darkened
    by passions! Jesus, heal my body scabbed with sins! Jesus, cleanse my mind
    from vain thoughts! Jesus, keep my heart from evil
    desires! Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me!
    </p>

<h1>Kontakion 12</h1>



Grant me Thy grace, O Jesus, Absolver of all debts, and receive me who repent, as Thou didst receive Peter who denied Thee, and call me who am downcast, as of old Thou didst call Paul who persecuted Thee, and hear me crying to Thee: Alleluia!


<h1>Oikos 12</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>Praising Thy Incarnation, we all glorify Thee and, with Thomas, we believe
    that Thou art our Lord and God, sitting with the Father and coming to judge
    the living and the dead. Grant that then I may stand on Thy right hand,
    who now cry:</p>
    <p> Jesus, Eternal King, have mercy on me! Jesus, sweet-scented
    Flower, make me fragrant! Jesus, beloved Warmth, make me warm! Jesus, Eternal
    Temple, shelter me! Jesus, Garment of Light, adorn me! Jesus, Pearl of
    great price, beam on me! Jesus, precious Stone, illumine me! Jesus, Sun
    of Righteousness, shine on me! Jesus, holy Light, make me radiant! Jesus,
    deliver me from sickness of soul and body! Jesus, rescue me from the hands
    of the adversary! Jesus, save me from the unquenchable fire and from the
    other eternal torments! Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me!
    </p>

<h1>Kontakion 13</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>O most sweet and most generous Jesus! Receive this our humble prayer,
    as Thou didst receive the widow's mite and keep Thy faithful people from
    all enemies, visible and invisible, from foreign invasion, from disease
    and hunger, from all tribulations and mortal wounds, and deliver from future
    torments all who cry to Thee: Alleluia! <span class="rubric">(Thrice)</span>

<h1> Prayers to Our Lord JESUS CHRIST</h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p>O All-wise and All-gracious Lord, Our Saviour, Who didst enlighten all
    the ends of the world by the radiance of Thy Coming, and Who didst call
    us into Thy Holy Church through the promise of the inheritance of incorruptible
    and eternal good! Graciously look down on us, Thy worthless servants, and
    remember not our iniquities, but according to Thy infinite mercies forgive
    all our sins. For though we transgress Thy holy will, we do not deny Thee,
    Our God and Saviour. Against Thee alone
    do we sin, yet Thee alone do we serve, in Thee alone do we believe,
    to Thee alone do we come, and Thy servants only do we wish to be. Remember
    the infirmity of our nature and the temptations of the adversary and the
    worldly enticements and seducements which surround us on all sides,
    and against which, according to Thy word, we can do nothing without Thy
    help. Cleanse us and save us! Enlighten our minds that we may firmly believe
    in Thee, our only Saviour and Redeemer! Inspire our hearts that we may
    wholly love Thee, our only God and Creator! Direct our steps that we may
    unstumblingly walk in the light of Thy commandments! Yea, our Lord and
    Creator, show us Thy great and abundant kindness, and make us live all
    the days of our life in holiness and truth, that at the time of Thy glorious Second
    Coming, we may be worthy to hear Thy gracious call into Thy Heavenly Kingdom.
    Grant us, Thy sinful and unprofitable servants, to receive Thy Kingdom,
    and that in the enjoyment of its ineffable beauty, we may ever glorify
    Thee, together with Thy Eternal Father and Thy Ever-living Divine Spirit
    to the ages of ages. Amen.
    </p>
    <p>Sweetest Lord Jesus, strong Son of God, Who didst shed Thy precious
    Blood and die for love of my love, I am ready to die for love of Thy love.
    Sweetest Jesus, my Life and my All, I love and adore Thee. Thee only do
    I wish for my Spouse, as Thou dost wish me for Thy bride. I give myself
    to Thee. I surrender myself to Thee. O Jesus, Thou Whose heart is ever
    turned to me, heal my heart, that I may feel the sweetness of Thy love,
    that I may taste no sweetness but Thee, seek no love but Thee, love no
    beauty but Thee. I have no desire but to please Thee and to do Thy will.
    Teach me to repent, and to take up the Cross daily and follow Thee with
    joy. Teach me to pray with faith and love. Thyself pray in me, that with
    Thee I may love my enemies and pray for them. Jesus, Thou art life in my
    death, strength in my weakness, light in my darkness, joy in my sorrow,
    courage in my faint heartedness, peace in my agitation, obedience in my
    prayer, glory in my dishonour, and deliverance from my dishonour. Glory
    and thanks to Thee Jesus my Saviour and Healer. Amen.
