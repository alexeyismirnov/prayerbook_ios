    nothingness hast brought all things into being; who hast created
    man after thine own image and likeness, and hast adorned him with
    every gift of thine;
    who givest unto those that ask of thee wisdom and understanding;
    who despisest not the sinner, but hast appointed repentance
    unto salvation; and hast vounchsafed unto us, thy humble and
    unworthy servants here, at this hour, to stand before the
    glory of thy holy Altar, and to render unto thee that adoration
    and praise which are thy due: Do thou, the same Lord,
    accept from the mouths of us sinners, the Thrice-Holy song, and
    visit us with thy beneficence.
    Pardon us every transgression, whether voluntary or involuntary. Sanctify
    both our souls and bodies, and grant that we may serve thee in
    uprightness all the days of our life: through the

<h1> The Cherubic Hymn and the Great Entry </h1>

<div class="colright">
    <p><span class="rubric">Choir:</span> Let us, the Cherubim mystically representing, and unto the life-giving Trinity the thrice-holy chant intoning, all cares terrestrial now lay aside.
    </p>
    <p class="rubric">(Here the Great Entrance, with the Holy Gifts, is made. And after it the Hymn is finished:)
    </p><p>
    That we may raise on high the King of all, like conqueror on shield and spears, by the Angelic Hosts invisibly up-borne. Alleluia. <span class="rubric">(Thrice.)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="rubric">The Priest saith the prayer of the Cherubic Hymn, secretly:</span>
    No one who is in bondage unto carnal desires and sensual pleasures is worthy to approach, or to come near, or to serve thee, O King of Glory: For to serve thee is a great and terrible thing even to the Heavenly Powers. Nevertheless, through thine unutterable and boundless love toward mankind thou didst become man, yet without change, and without transmutation, and art become our High Priest, and hast committed unto us the ministry of this unbloody Sacrifice, in that thou art Lord over all. For thou alone, O Lord our God, rulest over those in heaven and on earth; who art borne on the throne of the Cherubim; who art Lord of the Seraphim and King over Israel; who alone art holy and restest in the Saints. Therefore do I now make my entreaty unto thee, who alone art good and art ready to listen: Look down upon me, a sinner, and thine unprofitable servant, and cleanse my soul and my heart from an evil conscience; and by the might of thy Holy Spirit enable me, who am endued with the grace of the priesthood, to stand before this holy Altar, and perform the sacred Mystery of thy Holy and Pure Body and Precious Blood.
    For unto thee do I draw near, and bowing my neck I implore thee: turn not thy face from me, neither cast me out from among thy children; but graciously vouchsafe that I, a sinner and thine unworthy servant, may offer unto thee these Holy Gifts. For it is thou who offerest and art offered, who receivest and art thyself received, O Christ our God: and unto thee we ascribe glory, together with thy Father, who is from everlasting, and thine all-holy, and good, and life-giving Spirit, now, and ever, and unto ages of ages.
    </p>
    <p class="rubric">Then the Deacon taketh the censer, and having received the Priest's blessing, he censeth the Holy Altar round about, and the Sanctuary, saying, secretly, to himself, Psalm 50: Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy great goodness. Then the Priest and Deacon stand before the Altar, and make three reverences, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
    O God, cleanse thou me, a sinner.
    </p>
    <p><span class="rubric">
        The Priest, elevating his hands, saith in a low voice:</span> let us, the Cherubim mystically representing…now lay aside. <span class="rubric">{Thrice.} Then each finisheth the Hymn:</span>  That we may raise on high… <span class="rubric">And they kiss the Altar, and go to the Chapel of Oblation, which the Priest censeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="rubric">Then shall the Deacon say to the Priest:</span>
    Take up, Master.
    
    </p><p class="rubric">And the Priest, taking the air (vozdukh), shall lay it on the Deacon's left shoulder, and shall say:

    <p class="rubric">
    Then taking the holy paten (diskos), in like manner, he shall set it on the head of the Deacon, with all reverence, the Deacon holding the censer the while on one of his fingers. But the Priest himself shall take in his hand the holy chalice (potir), and they shall go forth the north door, preceded by a taper, and shall stand facing the People.

    <p class="rubric" align="center">The Great Entrance (following the Russian Service Book)</p>
    <p><span class="rubric">Deacon:</span> Our most God-fearing Ruler, may the Lord God remember in his kingdom always, now, and ever, and unto ages of ages.

    <p class="rubric">Then the Deacon shall enter in through the Holy Door, and shall take his stand on the right, and shall say to the Priest, as the latter entereth:
    </p>
    <p>May the Lord God remember thy priesthood in his kingdom.</p>
    <p><span class="rubric">And the Priest shall say to him:</span> May the Lord God remember thy diaconate in his kingdom always, now, and ever, and unto ages of ages.
    </p>
    <p class="rubric"> Then the Priest shall set the holy chalice upon the Holy Altar, to the right; taking the holy paten from the head of the Deacon, he shall place it also upon the Holy Altar, to the left, saying:</p>
    <p>
    Noble Joseph, when he had taken thy pure Body from the tree did wrap it in fine linen and spices, and sorrowing did lay it in a new sepulchre.
    </p><p>
    In the Grave with the body, but in Hell with the soul, in that thou art God; in Paradise with the thief, and on the throne with the Father and Spirit, wast thou, O Christ, filling all things, in that thou art infinite.
    </p><p>
    How life-giving, how than Paradise more fair and, of a truth, more splendid than any king's chamber, O Christ, is shown forth thy tomb, the fountain of our resurrection.
    </p><p class="rubric">
    Then shall he take the veils from the holy paten and the holy chalice, and shall lay them on one side of the Holy Altar; and having taken the air from the Deacon's shoulder, and censed it, he shall cover therewith the Holy Gifts, and shall say:
    </p><p>
    Noble Joseph, when he had taken thy pure Body from the tree did wrap it in fine linen and spices, and sorrowing did lay it in a new seplchre.
    </p><p class="rubric">
    Then taking the censer from the hands of the Deacons, he shall thrice cense the Holy Gifts, saying:
    </p><p>
    Exalt thou Zion by thy favour, O Lord, and let the walls of Jerusalem be built. Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with sacrifices and burnt-offerings; then shall they offer young bullocks upon thy altar.
    </p><p class="rubric">Then he shall give the censer to the Deacon, and shall bow his head, saying:
    </p><p>
    Remember me, O brother, and fellow-minister.
    </p><p class="rubric">And the Deacon shall say to him:
    </p><p>
    May the Lord God remember thy priesthood in his kingdom.
    </p><p class="rubric">The Deacon also, bowing his head, and holding his stole with three fingers of his right hand, shall say to the Priest:

    <p><span class="rubric">The Priest shall offer this Prayer, secretly:</span>
    It is meet and right that we should laud thee, bless thee, praise thee, give thanks unto thee, and adore thee in all places of thy dminion: for thou art God ineffable, incomprehensible, invisible, inconceivable; thou art from everlasting and art changeless, thou, and thine Only-begotten Son, and thy Holy Spirit. Thou from nothingness hast called us into being; and when we had fallen away from thee, thou didst raise us up again; and thou hast not ceased to do all things until thou hadst brought us back to heaven, and hadst endowed us with thy kingdom which is to come. For all which things we give thanks unto thee, and thine Only-begotten Son, and thy Holy Spirit; for all the things whereof we know, and whereof we know not; for all thy  benefits bestowed upon us, both manifest and unseen. And we render thanks unto thee for this ministry which thou dost deign to accept at our hands, although before thee stand thousands of Archangels and myriads of Angels, with the Cherubim, and Seraphim, six-winged, many-eyed, who soar aloft, born on their pinions.

    And we also, O Lord who lovest mankind, in company with these blessed Powers do cry aloud and say: Holy art thou, and all-holy thou, and thine Only-begotten Son, and thy Holy Spirit; holy and all-holy; and majestic is thy glory. Who hast so loved thy world that thou gavest thine Only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but should have everlasting life; who, when he had come and had performed all the dispensation for us, in the night in which he was given up, — in the which, rather, he did give himself fo rthe life of the world, — took bread in his holy and pure and sinless hands; and when he had given thanks, and blessed it, and so sanctified it, he gave it to his holy disciples and apostles, saying:
    </p>
    <p><span class="rubric">Priest, exclaiming:</span> Take, eat. this is my Body

    <p class="rubric">And the Priest shall bless it, and shall say:

    And make that which is in this chalice the precious Blood of thy Christ.
    </p>
    <p><span class="rubric">Deacon:</span> Amen.</p>
    <p class="rubric">
    And again, the Deacon, pointing to both the Holy Elements, shall say:

    <p>
    Master, bless both.

    condemnation.

    then the Deacon shall pour into the holy chalice, in the form of a cross, what is required, saying, secretly:

    <p>The warmth of the faith, full of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

    <p class="rubric">
    When the divine Blood of the Lord is mingled with the holy warm water, it must be done with heed, and in amount according to the number of those who desire to receive the Holy Sacrament.

    <p>
    Lo, I draw near unto the King Immortal and our God.
    </p><p>
    Impart unto me, Master, the precious and holy Body of our Lord, and God, and Saviour, Jesus Christ.

    <p class="rubric">And the Deacon shall kiss the Priest's hand as he taketh
    the Holy Body, and shall withdraw behind the Holy Altar; and bowing his head over the Holy Altar, he shall pray like the Priest:

    <p>I believe, O Lord, and I confess, that thou art, in very truth,
    the Christ, the Son of the living God: …

    <p class="rubric">
    All the Priests, in the order of their seniority, first make  an obeisance to each other, and to the People; and having besought forgiveness:</p>

    <p>I believe, O Lord, and I confess that thou art, in very truth, the Christ,
    the Son of the Living God, Who didst come into the world to save sinners,
    of whom I am chief.
    And I believe that this is, of a truth, thine all-pure Body and,
    that this is thine own precious Blood.
    Wherefore, I beseech thee, have mercy upon me,
    and forgive my transgressions, whether voluntary or involuntary;
    whether of word or of deed;
    whether committed with knowledge or in ignorance.
    And vouchsafe that I may partake without condemnation of thine all-pure
    Mysteries, unto the remission of my sins, and
    unto life eternal. Amen.
    
    </p>
    <p>Of thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God, accept me to-day as a communicant:
    for I will not speak of thy Mystery to thine enemies, neither, like Judas, will I give thee a kiss; but like the thief will I confess thee: Remember me, O
    Lord, in thy kingdom.
    
    </p>
    <p>And let not this participation in thy Holy Mysteries be unto judgment upon me, or unto , O Lord, but unto the healing of soul and body.

    And so shall they partake of the Holy Body which they hold in their hands, with awe, and all godly fear.

    And when they have partaken thereof, the Priests partake, in due order, of the Holy Blood from the chalice, thrice saying, secretly:

    The precious and holy Blood of our Lord, and God, and Saviour, Jesus Christ,
    is imparted to me, the servant of God, Priest, <span class="rubric">N.</span>,
    unto the remission of my sins, and unto life everlasting.
    </p><p>
    In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

    <p><span class="rubric">Sometimes:</span> O Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal One, have mercy upon us.

    <p class="rubric">
    Then having wiped his mouth and the holy chalice with the veil, which he holdeth in his hand, the Priest shall say, secretly:
    </p>
    <p>Lo, this hath touched my lips, and shall take away mine iniquities, and shall purge away my sins.
    </p>
    <p><span class="rubric">Then the Senior Priest saith again, secretly:</span> Deacon, draw near.

    Impart unto me, Master, the precious and holy Blood of our Lord and God,
    and Saviour, Jesus Christ.

    <p class="rubric">
    And the Priest, giving him the chalice, shall say, secretly:
    </p>
    <p>The servant of God, <span class="rubric">N.</span>, Deacon, partaketh of the precious and all-holy Blood of our Lord, and God, and Saviour, Jesus Christ, unto the remission of his sins, and unto life everlasting.

    <p class="rubric">
    And having communicated the Deacon, the Priest shall say, secretly:
    </p>
    <p>
    Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and shall take away thine iniquities, and shall purge away thy sins.
    </p>
    <p class="rubric">
    If there be any who desire to partake of the Holy Mysteries, the Priest shall divide the remaining portions, the NI and the KA, into small particles, sufficient for all, and place them in the chalice.
    </p>
    <p class="rubric">
    Then the Deacon, setting the holy paten above the holy chalice, saith these Hymns of the Resurrection, secretly:
    </p>
    <p>
    In that we have beheld the Resurrection of Christ, let us bow down before the holy Lord Jesus, the only sinless One. Thy Cross do we adore, O Christ, and thy holy Resurrection we laud and glorify: for thou art our God, and we know none other beside thee; we call upon thy Name. O come, all ye faithful, let us adore Christ's holy Resurrection. For lo, through the Cross is joy come into all the world. Ever blessing the Lord, let us sing his Resurrection: for in that he endured the Cross he hath destroyed Death by death.
    </p><p>
    Shine, shine, O new Jerusalem, for the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee! Shout now and be glad, O Zion! And do thou, O Pure One, Birth-giver of God, rejoice in the Rising-again of him whom thou didst bear.
    </p><p>
    O Christ, Passover great and most Holy! O Wisdom, Word, and Power of God! Vouchsafe that we may more perfectly partake of thee in the days which know no evening of thy kingdom.
    </p><p class="rubric">
    While with the sponge he wipeth all the particles into the chalice with all care and reverence, he saith:
    </p><p>
    Wash away, O Lord, the sins of all who are here commemorated, by thy precious Blood, through the prayers of thy Saints.
    </p><p class="rubric">
    And he shall cover the holy chalice with the veil; and in like manner shall cover the holy paten with the start-cover and the veil. Then the Priest shall recite the Prayer of Thanskgiving, secretly.
    </p><p>
    We give thanks unto thee, O Lord, who lovest mankind, Benefactor of our souls and bodies, for that thou hast vouchsafed this day to feed us with thy heavenly and immortal Mysteries. Guide our path aright; stablish us all in thy fear; guard our life; make sure our steps: through the prayers and supplications of the glorious Birth-giver of God and ever-virgin Mary, and of all thy Saints.

<div class="colright">
    <p class="rubric">Then the Holy Door is opened, and the Deacon, making a reverence, shall approach the Holy Door; and he taketh from the Bishop or the Priest the holy chalice, and elevating it, he saith:
