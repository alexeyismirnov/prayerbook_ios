<h4><a name="1"></a>Song 1.</h4>


<p><span class="rubric">Eirmos:</span> In the deep
of old the infinite Power overwhelmed Pharoah's whole army. But the Incarnate
Word annihilated pernicious sin. Exceedingly glorious is the Lord, for
gloriously has He been glorified.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Troparia:</span>

</p><p>Sweetest Jesus Christ, longsuffering Jesus, heal the wounds of my soul,
Jesus, and make sweet my heart, O Most Merciful One, I ask Thee, Jesus
my Saviour, that being saved by Thee, I may glorify Thee.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>Sweetest Jesus Christ, Jesus, open to me the door of repentance, O Jesus,
Lover of men, and accept me as I throw myself at Thy feet, Jesus, my Saviour,
and fervently implore the forgiveness of my sins.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>Sweetest Jesus Christ, Jesus, snatch me from the hand of deceitful satan,
O Jesus, and make me stand on the Right of Thy glory, O Jesus my Saviour;
from the Left deliver me.

</p><p><i>Most Holy Mother of God save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Theotokion:</span> O Lady who bore Jesus
our God, pray for us worthless slaves, that by thy prayers, O immaculate
one, we who are defiled may be delivered from torment, O spotless one,
and enjoy everlasting glory.


</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Song 3.</h4>


<p><span class="rubric">Eirmos :</span> By establishing me on the
rock of faith, Thou hast given me power over my enemies, and my spirit
rejoices when I sing: There is none holy as our God and none righteous
but Thee, O Lord.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Troparia:</span>

</p><p>O my Jesus, Lover of men, hear Thy slave calling with compunction; and
deliver me, Jesus, from condemnation and punishment, O only Patient One,
sweetest and most merciful Jesus.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>Receive Thy slave, O my Jesus, who prostrates himself with tears, my
Jesus, and deliver me, O Lord, from hell, sweetest and most merciful Jesus.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>O my Jesus, the time Thou gavest me I have squandered in passions, O
my Jesus. Reject me not, O my Jesus, but call me, I pray, O Lord, O Sweetest
Jesus, and save me!

</p><p><i>Most Holy Mother of God save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Theotokion:</span> O Virgin who gavest
birth to my Jesus, implore Him to save me from hell. Thou art the only
patroness of the afflicted, O thou who art full of divine grace. And make
me worthy of the life that is free from old age, O all-innocent one.

</p><p>Lord, have mercy <span class="rubric">(thrice).</span>

</p><p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and
ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

</p><p><span class="rubric">Sedalion</span> (Sitting hymn): O Jesus
my Saviour, Thou didst save the prodigal. Jesus my Saviour, Thou didst
accept the harlot. And now have mercy on me, most merciful Jesus; have
compassion and save me, O Jesus my Benefactor, as Thou hadst compassion
on Manasseh, my Jesus, only Lover of men.

</p><p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and
ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

</p><p><span class="rubric">Theotokion:</span> Having thy intercession,
O most pure one, and delivered by thy prayers, and protected by the Cross
of thy Son, we duly devoutly magnify thee.


</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Song 4.</h4>


<p><span class="rubric">Eirmos:</span> From a virgin didst Thou
come, not as an ambassador, nor as an Angel, but the very Lord Himself incarnate,
and didst save me, the whole man. Therefore I cry to Thee: Glory to Thy Power,
O Lord.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Troparia:</span>

</p><p>O my Jesus, heal the wounds of my soul, my Jesus, I pray, and snatch
me from the hand of soul-corrupting satan, my gracious Jesus, and save
me.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>O my sweetest Jesus, I have sinned. My compassionate Jesus, save me
who run to Thy protection, and make me worthy of Thy Kingdom, O most patient
Jesus.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>No one has sinned as I have sinned, O my Jesus, wretched as I am; but
now I bow down and pray: Save me, O my Jesus, and bequeath me, my Jesus,
life.

</p><p><i>Most Holy Mother of God save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Theotokion:</span> O all-hymned Virgin
who bore the Lord Jesus, implore Him to deliver from torment all who sing
to thee and call thee supremely Mother of God.


</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>Song 5.</h4>


<p></p><p><span class="rubric">Eirmos:</span> O Thou Who art the Light
of those lying in darkness, and the salvation of the hopeless, O Christ
my Saviour, I rise early to pray to Thee, O King of Peace. Enlighten me
with Thy radiance, for I know no other God than Thee.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Troparia:</span>

</p><p>O my Jesus, Thou art the light of my mind and the salvation of my despairing
soul, my Jesus, my Saviour! Deliver me who cry to Thee, from torment and
hell. Save me, O Christ, my Jesus, wretched as I am.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>Completely cast down to shameful passions, my Jesus, I now cry: Stretch
down to me, my Jesus, a helping hand, and pluck me out as I cry: save me,
O Christ, my Jesus, wretched as I am.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>Carrying about a mind defiled, I call to Thee, O Jesus: cleanse me from
the dirt of sin, and redeem me who slipped down to the depths of vice through
ignorance, and save me, O Saviour, my Jesus, I pray.

</p><p><i>Most Holy Mother of God save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Theotokion:</span> O Maiden Mother of God
who bore Jesus, implore Him to save all Orthodox monks and people, and
to deliver from hell those who cry: We know no stronger intercession than
thine.


</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a>Song 6.</h4>


<p></p><p><span class="rubric">Eirmos :</span> Whirled about in the abyss
of sin, I appeal to the unfathomable abyss of Thy compassion: Raise me
up from corruption, O God.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Troparia:</span>
<br>O most merciful Christ, my Jesus, accept me who confess my sins, O
Lord, and save me, O Jesus, and snatch me, O Jesus, from corruption.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>O my Jesus, no one else has been so dissolute as I, wretched as I am,
O Jesus Lover of men, but save me, O Jesus.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>O my Jesus, I have surpassed with my passions the harlot and the prodigal,
Manasseh and the publican, O my Jesus, and the robber and the Ninevites,
O Jesus.

</p><p><i>Most Holy Mother of God save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Theotokion:</span> O thou who conceivedst
my Jesus Christ, O only undefiled and immaculate Virgin, cleanse me defiled
as I am, even now by hyssop of thy prayers.

</p><p>Lord have mercy <span class="rubric">(thrice).</span>

</p><p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and
ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

</p><p><span class="rubric">Kontakion:</span> Sweetest Jesus, Light
of the world, enlighten the eyes of my soul, O Son of God, with the
divine vision of Thy splendour, that I may praise Thee, the unwaning Light.


</p>
<h4><a name="7"></a>Song 7.</h4>


<p><span class="rubric">Eirmos:</span> When the golden idol was
worshipped in the plain of Dura, Thy three children despised the godless
order. Thrown into the fire, they were bedewed and sang: Blessed art Thou, O God
of our fathers.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i></p>

<p></p><p><span class="rubric">Troparia:</span>

</p><p>O Christ Jesus, no one on earth has ever sinned as I have sinned, O
my Jesus, wretched and dissolute as I am. But I cry to Thee, my Jesus,
have compassion on me as I sing: Blessed art Thou, O God of our fathers.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>O Christ Jesus, nail me down with the fear of Thee, I pray, O
my Jesus, and guide me to Thy calm haven, O my compassionate Jesus, that
saved by Thee I may sing to Thee: Blessed art Thou, O God of our fathers.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>O Christ Jesus, ten thousand times I promised Thee repentance, my Jesus,
but wretch that I am, I deceived Thee. Therefore I cry to Thee, my Jesus:
Enlighten my still unfeeling soul, O Christ, who art the God of our fathers.

</p><p><i>Most Holy Mother of God save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Theotokion:</span> O thou who gavest birth
to Jesus Christ wondrously and above nature, O all - innocent one, implore
Him, O Maiden, to forgive me all the sins that I have committed against
my nature, that saved I may cry: Blessed art thou who didst conceive God
in the flesh.


</p>
<h4><a name="8"></a>Song 8.</h4>


<p><span class="rubric">Eirmos:</span> Sing of the acts of God
Who descended into the fiery furnace with the Hebrew children and changed
the flame into dew, and exalt Him as Lord throughout all ages.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Troparia:</span>

</p><p>I implore Thee, O my Jesus: as Thou didst redeem the harlot from many
sins, likewise redeem me, O Christ my Jesus, and cleanse my foul soul,
O my Jesus.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>O Jesus, having yielded to dumb and irrational pleasures, I have
become dumb and irrational, O my Jesus, and wretch that I am, I have
truly become pitifully like the animals, O Saviour. Therefore, O Jesus,
deliver me from dumbness and animality.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>O Jesus, I fell into the hands of soul-corrupting thieves who have now
stripped me of my divinely woven garment, O my Jesus, and I am lying all
bruised and wounded. O my Christ, pour on me oil and wine.

</p><p><i>Most Holy Mother of God save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Theotokion:</span> O Mary, Mother of God,
who ineffably bore the Christ, my Jesus and God, implore Him always
to save from dangers thy servants and thy singers, O chaste Virgin!


</p>
<h4><a name="9"></a>Song 9.</h4>


<p><span class="rubric">Eirmos:</span> God the Word, God of God,
Who by ineffable wisdom came to create Adam anew after his grievous fall
to corruption through eating and Who took flesh beyond all telling from
the Holy Virgin for our sake - Him we faithful with
one accord magnify in song.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Troparia:</span>
<br>I have surpassed, O my Jesus, Manasseh and the publican, the harlot
and the prodigal, O compassionate Jesus, and the robber, O my Jesus, through
all my shameful and perverse deeds, O Jesus, but outwit me, my Jesus, and
save me!

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>My Jesus, I have outdone by my pitiful passions, wretched as I am, all
Who have sinned from Adam, O Jesus, before the Law and in the Law, my Jesus,
and after the Law and Grace; but save me by Thy judgments, my Jesus.

</p><p><i>Sweetest Jesus, save us.</i>

</p><p>Let me not be divorced from Thy ineffable glory, my Jesus, and let me
not be assigned to the Left Hand, sweetest Jesus; but set me on the Right
Hand with Thy sheep and give me rest, O Christ my Jesus, in Thy divine
compassion.

</p><p><i>Most Holy Mother of God save us.</i>

</p><p><span class="rubric">Theotokion:</span> O Mother of God who
bore Jesus, only Immaculate Virgin Mary, invoke Him, O pure one, as thy
Son and Creator, to deliver all who resort to thee from temptations, dangers
and future fire.

</p><p><span class="rubric">Exapostelarion:</span> O Jesus, Giver of
Wisdom and Understanding, Feeder of beggars, Protector of Orphans,
Healer of the sick, heal and illumine my heart, O Jesus, covered with the wounds
of sin and corruption of passions, and save me. O Jesus!

</p><p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and
ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

</p><p><span class="rubric">Theotokion:</span> Enlighten my mind
and transfigure my heart, O Virgin, with the radiance of the Light which
shone through thee, dispelling the darkness of sin and dissolving the gloom
of my indolence.
</p>

<h4><a name="10"></a>Prayer to Jesus Christ.</h4>


<p>O Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, my God, through Thy ineffable love
for men Thou wast wrapped in flesh, at the end of the ages, from the EverVirgin
Mary. We glorify Thy saving providence and care for us, Thy servants, O
Lord. We praise Thee through Whom we have learned to know the Father. We
bless Thee through Whom the Holy Spirit came into the world. We bow to
Thy most Holy Mother who served for the dread mystery of Thy Incarnation.
We praise the Angelic Choir as the servants and singers of Thy Majesty.
We beatify Saint John the Forerunner who baptized Thee, O Lord. We honour
also the Prophets who announced Thee. We glorify Thy Holy Apostles. We celebrate
the Martyrs. We praise Thy Priests. We venerate Thy Saints and sing to
all the Just. We, Thy servants, offer to Thee, our all-generous God, this
countless and unutterable Divine Choir as intercessors, and pray: Grant
us the forgiveness of our sins for the sake of all Thy Saints, but especially
for the sake of Thy holy generosity, for Thou art blessed for ever. Amen.
