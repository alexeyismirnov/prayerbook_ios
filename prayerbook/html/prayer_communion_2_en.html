    Angel</h4>


<p></p><p>Holy Angel of Christ, I fall down and pray to thee, my holy Guardian,
given me from holy Baptism for the protection of my sinful body and soul.
By my laziness and bad habits, I have angered thy most pure light, and
have driven thee away from me by
all my shameful deeds, lies, slanders, envy, condemnation, scorn, disobedience,
brotherly-hatred, grudges, love of money, adultery, anger, meanness, greed,
excess, talkativeness, negative and evil thoughts, proud ways, dissolute
madness, having self-will in all the desires of the flesh. O my evil will,
which even the dumb animals do not follow! How canst thou look at me or
approach me who am like a stinking dog? With what eyes, O Angel of Christ,
wilt thou look at me so badly snared in evil deeds? How can I ask forgiveness
for my bitter, evil and wicked deeds, into which I fall every day and night,
and every hour? But I fall down and pray, O my holy Guardian: pity me,
thy sinful and unworthy servant <span class="rubric">(Name)</span>. Be my helper and protector
against my wicked enemy, by thy holy prayers, and make me a partaker of
the Kingdom of God with all the Saints, always, now and ever, and to the
ages of ages. Amen.
