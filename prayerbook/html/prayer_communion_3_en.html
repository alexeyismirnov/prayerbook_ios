<p>Then the following Psalms: 23, 24, 116: 10-19 (King James text); 22, 23, 115
(Septuagint).


</p>
<h4><a name="1"></a>Psalm 22.</h4>



<p>The Lord is my Shepherd, and will deny me nothing. He has settled me
in a green pasture, and nourished me beside refreshing water. He has converted
my soul, and led me in the paths of righteousness for His Name's sake.
For even though I walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear
no evil, for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff have comforted me.
Thou hast prepared a table before me in the face of those who trouble
me. Thou hast anointed my head with oil. And Thy chalice which inebriates
me, how glorious it is! And Thy mercy will follow me all the days of my
life. And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord throughout the length
of my days.


</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Psalm 23.</h4>



<p>The earth is the Lord's and all that is in it, the world and all who dwell in it
He has set it on the seas, and prepared it on the rivers.
Who will ascend the mountain of the Lord, or who will stand in His
holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not set his
mind on vanity or sworn deceitfully to his neighbour. He will receive a
blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour. These are the kind
who seek the Lord, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Lift up your
gates, you princes, and be lifted up, you eternal doors, and the King of
Glory will enter. Who is this King of Glory? The Lord strong and mighty,
the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your gates, you princes, and be lifted
up, you eternal doors, and the King of Glory will enter. Who is this King
of Glory? The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.


</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Psalm 115.</h4>



<p>I believed and so I spoke; but I was deeply humiliated. I said in my
madness: every man is a liar. What shall I give in return to the Lord for
all that He has given me? I will receive the cup of salvation and call
on the Name of the Lord. I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence
of all His people. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His
Saints.

</p>
<p>O Lord, I am Thy slave; I am Thy slave and son of Thy handmaid. Thou
hast broken my bonds asunder. I will offer Thee the sacrifice of praise,
and will pray in the Name of the Lord. I will pay my vows to the Lord in
the presence of all His people, in the courts of the Lord's house, in the
midst of thee, O Jerusalem.

</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and
ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

</p>
<p>Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to Thee, O God. <span class="rubric">(Thrice) </span>Lord,
have mercy <span class="rubric">(Thrice). And then the following prayers:</span>

</p>
<p>Overlook my faults, O Lord Who wast born of a Virgin, and purify my
heart, and make it a temple for Thy spotless Body and Blood. Let me not
be rejected from Thy presence, O Thou Who hast infinitely great mercy.

</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

</p>
<p>How can I who am unworthy dare to come to the communion of Thy Holy
Things? For even if I should dare to approach Thee with those who are worthy,
my garment betrays me, for it is not a festal robe, and I shall cause the
condemnation of my sinful soul. Cleanse, O Lord, the pollution from my
soul, and save me as the Lover of men.

</p>
<p>Now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

</p>
<p>Great is the multitude of my sins, O Mother of God. To thee, O pure
one, I flee and implore salvation. Visit my sick and feeble soul and intercede
with thy Son and our God, that He may grant me forgiveness for the terrible
things I have done, O thou who alone art blessed.

</p>
<p><span class="rubric">On Holy and Great Thursday the following is read:</span>

</p>
<p>When Thy glorious Disciples were enlightened at the Supper by the feet-washing,
then impious Judas was darkened with the disease of avarice, and he delivered
Thee, the Just Judge, to lawless judges. See, O lover of money, this man
through money came to hang himself. Flee the insatiable desire which dared
to do such things to the Master. O Lord, Who art good towards all, glory
to Thee.
</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a>Psalm 50.</h4>

<p>Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassions, blot out my transgression. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I realize my iniquity, and my sin is before me continually. Against Thee only have I sinned I and done evil in Thy sight, that Thou mayest be justified in Thy words and win when Thou art judged.For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother desire me. For, lo, Thou lovest truth; the unknown and secret things of Thy wis dom Thou hast made known to me. Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall become whiter than snow.Thou shalt make me hear joy and gladness; the bones that have been humbled will rejoice. Turn Thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Thy face, I and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, and confirm me with a princely spirit. I shall teach Thy ways to the lawless and the godless will return to Thee. Deliver me from blood, O God - O God of my salvation - and my tongue shall extol Thy justice. O Lord, Thou wilt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise. For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would have given it; but burnt offerings do not please Thee. The sacrifice for God is a contrite spirit; a contrite and humble heart God will not despise. Gladden Sion, O Lord, with Thy good will; and let the walls of Jerusalem be built. Then Thou wilt be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, the oblation and burnt offerings; then they will offer calves on Thine altar. </p>

<h4><a name="4"></a>Prayer of St. Basil
    the Great</h4>



<p>O Sovereign Lord Jesus Christ our God, source of life and immortality,
Who art the Author of all creation, visible and invisible, the equally
everlasting and co-eternal Son of the eternal Father, Who through the excess
of Thy goodness didst in the last days assume our flesh and wast crucified for us, ungrateful and ignorant
as we were, and didst cause through Thy own Blood the restoration of our
nature which had been marred by sin: O immortal King, accept the repentance
even of me a sinner, and incline Thine ear to me and hear my words. For
I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned against heaven and before Thee, and
I am not worthy to gaze on the height of Thy glory; for I have provoked
Thy goodness by transgressing Thy commandments and not obeying Thy orders.
But Thou, O Lord, in Thy forbearance, patience, and great mercy, hast not
given me up to be destroyed with my sins, but Thou awaitest my complete
conversion. For Thou, O Lover of men, hast said through Thy Prophet that
Thou desirest not the death of the sinner, but that he should return to
Thee and live. For Thou dost not will, O Lord, that the work
of Thy hands should be destroyed, neither dost Thou delight in the
destruction of men, but Thou desirest that all should be saved and come
to a knowledge of the Truth. Therefore, though I am unworthy both of heaven
and earth, and even of this transient life, since I have completely succumbed
to sin and am a slave to pleasure and have defaced Thy image, yet being
Thy work and creation, wretch that I am, even I do not despair of my salvation
and dare to draw near to Thy boundless compassion. So receive even me,
O Christ Lover of men, as the harlot, as the thief, as the publican, and
as the prodigal; and take from me the heavy burden of my sins, Thou Who
takest away the sin of the world, Who healest men's sicknesses, Who
callest the weary and heavy laden to Thyself and givest them rest; for
Thou camest not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. And purify
me from all defilement of flesh and spirit. Teach me to achieve perfect
holiness in the fear of Thee, that with the clear witness of my conscience
I may receive the portion of Thy holy Things and be united with Thy holy
Body and Blood, and have Thee dwelling and remaining in me with the Father
and Thy Holy Spirit. And, O Lord Jesus Christ, my God, let not
the communion of Thy immaculate and life-giving Mysteries be to me for
condemnation nor let it make me sick in body or soul through my partaking
of them unworthily; but grant me till my last breath to receive without
condemnation the portion of Thy holy Things, for communion with the Holy
Spirit, as a provision for eternal life, and as an acceptable defense at
Thy dread tribunal, so that I too with all Thy elect may become a partaker
of Thy pure joys which Thou hast prepared for those who love Thee, O Lord,
in whom Thou art glorified throughout the ages. Amen.


</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>Prayer of our Father in the Saints, John Chrysostom</h4>

<p>O Lord my God, I know that I am not worthy or sufficient that Thou shouldest
come under the roof of the house of my soul, for all is desolate and fallen,
and Thou hast not with me a place fit to lay Thy head. But as from the
highest heaven Thou didst humble Thyself for our sake, so now conform Thyself
to my humility. And as Thou didst consent to lie in a cave and in a manger
of dumb beasts, so also consent to lie in the manger of my unspiritual
soul and to enter my defiled body. And as Thou
didst not disdain to enter and dine with sinners in the house of Simon
the Leper, so consent also to enter the house of my humble soul which is
leprous and sinful. And as Thou didst not reject the woman, who was
a harlot and a sinner like me, when
she approached and touched Thee, so also be compassionate with me,
a sinner, as I approach and touch Thee, and let the live coal of Thy most
holy Body and precious Blood be for the sanctification and enlightenment
and strengthening of my humble soul and body, for a relief from the burden
of my many sins, for a protection from all diabolical practices, for a
restraint and a check on my evil and wicked way of life, for the mortification
of passions, for the keeping of Thy commandments, for an increase of Thy
divine grace, and for the advancement of Thy Kingdom. For it is not insolently
that I draw near to Thee, O Christ my God, but as taking courage from Thy
unspeakable goodness, and that I may not by long abstaining from Thy communion
become a prey to the spiritual wolf. Therefore, I pray Thee, O Lord, Who alone
art holy, sanctify my soul and body, my mind and heart, my emotions and
affections, and wholly renew me. Root the fear of Thee in my members, and
make Thy sanctification indelible in me. Be also my helper and defender,
guide my life in peace, and make me worthy to stand on Thy right hand with
Thy Saints: through the prayers and intercessions of Thy immaculate Mother,
of Thy ministering Angels, of the immaculate Powers and of all the Saints
who have ever been pleasing to Thee. Amen.


</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a>Prayer of Saint Simeon the Meditative</h4>


<p>O only pure and sinless Lord, Who through the ineffable compassion of
Thy love for men didst assume our whole nature through the pure and virgin
blood of her who supernaturally conceived Thee by the coming of the Divine
Spirit and by the will of the Eternal Father; O Christ Jesus, Wisdom and
Peace and Power of God, Who in Thy assumption of our nature didst suffer
Thy life-giving and saving Passion - the Cross, the Nails, the Spear, and
Death - mortify all the deadly passions of my body. Thou Who in Thy burial
didst spoil the dominions of hell, bury with good thoughts my evil schemes
and scatter the spirits of wickedness. Thou Who by Thy life-giving Resurrection
on the third day didst raise up our fallen first Parent, raise me up who
am sunk in sin and suggest to me ways of repentance. Thou Who by Thy glorious
Ascension didst deify our nature which Thou hadst assumed and didst honor
it by Thy session at the right hand of the Father, make me worthy by partaking
of Thy holy Mysteries of a place at Thy right hand among those who are
saved. Thou Who by the descent of the Spirit, the Paraclete,
didst make Thy holy Disciples worthy vessels, make me also a recipient
of His coming. Thou Who art to come again to judge the World with justice,
grant me also to meet Thee on the clouds, my Maker and Creator, with all
Thy Saints, that I may unendingly glorify and praise Thee with Thy Eternal
Father and Thy all-holy and good and life-giving Spirit, now and ever,
and to the ages of ages. Amen.

<h4><a name="7"></a>Prayer of the Divine Damascene</h4>


<p>O Sovereign Lord Jesus Christ our God, Who alone hast authority to forgive
men their sins, overlook in Thy goodness and love for men all my offences
whether committed with knowledge or in ignorance, and make me worthy to
receive without condemnation Thy divine, glorious, spotless, and life-giving
Mysteries, not for punishment, nor for an increase of sins, but for purification
and sanctification and as a pledge of the life and kingdom to come, as
a protection and help, and for the destruction of enemies, and for the
blotting out of my many transgressions. For Thou art a God of mercy and
compassion and love for men, and to Thee we send up the glory, with the
Father and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

<h4><a name="8"></a>Prayer of Saint Basil the Great</h4>


<p>I know, O Lord, that I partake of Thy immaculate Body and precious Blood
unworthily, and that I am guilty, and eat and drink judgment to myself
by not discerning the Body and Blood of Thee my Christ and God. But taking
courage from Thy compassion I approach Thee, for Thou hast said: "He who
eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood abides in Me and I in him." Therefore
have compassion, O Lord, and do not make an example of me, a sinner, but
deal with me according to Thy mercy; and let these Holy Things be for my
healing and purification and enlightenment and protection and salvation
and sanctification of body and soul, for the turning away of every phantasy
and all evil practice and diabolical activity working subconsciously in
my members, for confidence and love towards Thee, for reformation of life
and security, for an increase of virtue and perfection, for fulfillment
of the commandments, for communion with the Holy Spirit, as a provision
for eternal life, and as an acceptable defense at Thy dread Tribunal, not
for judgment or for condemnation.

<h4><a name="9"></a>Prayer of Saint Simeon the New Divine</h4>
<div align="center">
    <p>From sullied lips,
    <br> From an abominable heart,
    <br>From an unclean tongue,
    <br>Out of a polluted soul,
    <br>Receive my prayer, O my Christ.
    <br>Reject me not,
    <br>Nor my words, nor my ways,
    <br>Nor even my shamelessness,
    <br>But give me courage to say
    <br>What I desire, my Christ.
    <br>And even more, teach me
    <br>What to do and say.
    <br>I have sinned more than the harlot
    <br>Who, on learning where Thou wast lodging,
    <br>Bought myrrh,
    
    <br>And dared to come and anoint
    <br>Thy feet, my Christ,
    <br>My Lord and my God.
    <br>As Thou didst not repulse her
    <br>When she drew near from her heart,
    <br>Neither, O Word, abominate me,
    <br>But grant me Thy feet
    <br>To clasp and kiss,
    <br>And with a flood of tears
    <br>As with most precious myrrh
    <br>Dare to anoint them.
    <br>Wash me with my tears
    <br>And purify me with them, O Word.
    <br>Forgive my sins
    <br>And grant me pardon.
    <br>Thou knowest the multitude of my evil-doings,
    <br>Thou knowest also my wounds,
    
    <br>And Thou seest my bruises.
    <br>But also Thou knowest my faith,
    <br>And Thou beholdest my willingness,
    <br>And Thou hearest my sighs.
    <br>Nothing escapes Thee, my God,
    <br>My Maker, my Redeemer,
    <br>Not even a tear-drop,
    <br>Nor part of a drop.
    <br>Thine eyes know
    <br>What I have not achieved,
    <br>And in Thy book
    <br>Things not yet done
    <br>Are written by Thee.
    <br>See my depression,
    <br>See how great is my trouble,
    <br>And all my sins
    <br>Take from me, O God of all,
    
    <br>That with a clean heart,
    <br>Trembling mind
    <br>And contrite spirit
    <br>I may partake of Thy pure
    <br>And all-holy Mysteries
    <br>By which all who eat and drink Thee
    <br>With sincerity of heart
    <br>Are quickened and deified.
    <br>For Thou, my Lord, hast said:
    <br>"Whoever eats My Flesh
    <br>And drinks My Blood
    <br>Abides in Me
    <br>And I in Him."
    <br>Wholly true is the word
    <br>Of my Lord and God.
    <br>For whoever partakes of Thy divine
    <br>And deifying Gifts
    
    <br>Certainly is not alone,
    <br>But is with Thee, my Christ,
    <br>Light of the Triune Sun
    <br>Which illumines the world.
    <br>And that I may not remain alone
    <br>Without Thee, the Giver of Life,
    <br>My Breath, my Life,
    <br>My Joy,
    <br>The Salvation of the world,
    <br>Therefore I have drawn near to Thee
    <br>As Thou seest, with tears
    <br>And with a contrite spirit.
    <br>Ransom of my offences,
    <br>I beseech Thee to receive me,
    <br>And that I may partake without condemnation
    <br>Of Thy life-giving and perfect Mysteries,
    <br>That Thou mayest remain as Thou hast said
    
    <br>With me, thrice-wretched as I am,
    <br>Lest the tempter may find me
    <br>Without Thy grace
    <br>And craftily seize me,
    <br>And having deceived me, may seduce me,
    <br>From Thy deifying words.
    <br>Therefore I fall at Thy feet
    <br>And fervently cry to Thee:
    <br>As Thou receivedst the Prodigal
    <br>And the Harlot who drew near to Thee,
    <br>So have compassion and receive me,
    <br>The profligate and the prodigal,
    <br>As with contrite spirit
    <br>I now draw near to Thee.
    <br>I know, O Saviour, that no other
    <br>Has sinned against Thee as I,
    <br>Nor has done the deeds
    
    <br>That I have committed.
    <br>But this again I know
    <br>That not the greatness of my offences
    <br>Nor the multitude of my sins
    <br>Surpasses the great patience
    <br>Of my God,
    <br>And His extreme love for men.
    <br>But with the oil of compassion
    <br>Those who fervently repent
    <br>Thou dost purify and enlighten
    <br>And makest them children of the light,
    <br>Sharers of Thy Divine Nature.
    <br>And Thou dost act most generously,
    <br>For what is strange to Angels
    <br>And to the minds of men
    <br>Often Thou tellest to them
    <br>As to Thy true friends.
    
    <br>These things make me bold, my Christ,
    <br>These things give me wings,
    <br>And I take courage from the wealth
    <br>Of Thy goodness to us.
    <br>And rejoicing and trembling at once,
    <br>I who am straw partake of fire,
    <br>And, strange wonder!
    <br>I am ineffably bedewed,
    <br>Like the bush of old
    <br>Which burnt without being consumed.
    <br>Therefore with thankful mind,
    <br>And with thankful heart,
    <br>And with thankfulness in all the members
    <br>Of my soul and body,
    <br>I worship and magnify
    <br>And glorify Thee, my God,
    <br>For Thou art blessed,
    
    <br>Now and throughout the ages.
    </p>

<h4>Prayer of Saint John Chrysostom</h4>
<p>
O God, loosen, remit and forgive my sins against thee, whether in word, in deed, or in thought, willingly or unwillingly, knowingly or unknowingly committed, forgive them all; for thou art good and lovest mankind. And, through the prayers of thy most holy Mother, of thy heavenly Servants and holy Powers, and of all the Saints who have found favour in thy sight, bless me to receive uncondemned thy holy and immaculate Body and thy precious Blood, to the healing of my soul and body, and to the driving away of my evil imaaginations; for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to ages of ages. Amen.
</p>
<h4><a name="10"></a>Another of Saint Chrysostom</h4>

<p>I am not worthy, O Lord and Master, that Thou shouldest enter under
the roof of my soul; but since Thou in Thy love for men dost will to dwell
in me, I take courage and approach. Thou commandest: I will open wide the
doors which Thou alone didst create, that Thou mayest enter with love as is Thy nature, enter and
enlighten my darkened thought. I believe that Thou wilt do this, for Thou
didst not banish the Harlot who approached Thee with tears, nor didst Thou
reject the Publican who repented, nor didst Thou drive away the Thief who
acknowledged Thy Kingdom, nor didst Thou leave the repentant persecutor
(Paul) to himself; but all who had been brought to Thee by repentance Thou didst
set in the company of Thy friends, O Thou Who alone art blessed always,
now and to endless ages. Amen.

</p>
<h4><a name="11"></a>Another Prayer of Saint Chrysostom</h4>


<p>Lord Jesus Christ my God, remit, forgive, absolve and pardon the sins,
offences and transgressions which I, Thy sinful, useless and unworthy servant
have committed from my youth, up to the present day and hour, whether with
knowledge or in ignorance, whether by words or deeds or intentions or thoughts,
and whether by habit or through any of my senses. And through the intercession
of her who conceived Thee without seed, the immaculate and ever-virgin
Mary Thy Mother, my only sure hope and protection and salvation, make me
worthy without condemnation to receive Thy pure, immortal, life-giving
and dread Mysteries, for forgiveness of sins and for eternal life, for sanctification
and enlightenment and strength and healing and health of soul and body,
and for the blotting out and complete destruction of my evil reasonings
and intentions and prejudices and nocturnal fantasies of dark evil spirits.
For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory and the honour and
the worship, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to
the ages of ages. Amen.


</p>
<h4><a name="12"></a>Prayer of Saint John Damascene</h4>




<p></p>
<p>I stand before the doors of Thy sanctuary, yet I do not put away my
terrible thoughts. But O Christ our God, Who didst justify the Publican,
and have mercy on the Canaanite woman, and didst open the gates of Paradise
to the Thief, open to me the depths of Thy love for men, and as I approach
and touch Thee, receive me like the Harlot and the woman with an issue
of blood. For the one received healing easily by touching the hem of Thy
garment, and the other by clasping Thy sacred feet obtained release from
her sins. And I, in my pitiableness, dare to receive Thy whole Body. Let
me not be burnt, but receive me even as these; enlighten the senses of
my soul, and burn the stains of my sins: through the intercessions of her
who bore Thee without seed, and of the Heavenly Powers, for Thou art blessed
to the ages of ages. Amen.

</p>
<h4><a name="13"></a>Prayer of Saint John Chrysostom</h4>

<p>I believe, O Lord, and I confess that Thou art truly the Christ, the
Son of the Living God, Who came into the world to save sinners, of whom
I am the chief. And I believe that this is Thy pure Body and Thy own precious
Blood. Therefore, I pray Thee, have mercy on me and forgive my transgressions, voluntary and
involuntary, in word and deed, known and unknown. And grant that I may
partake of Thy Holy Mysteries without condemnation, for the remission of
sins and for life eternal. Amen.


</p>
<h4><a name="14"></a>Lines of St. Symeon the
    Translator</h4>



<p>Behold I approach for Divine Communion.
<br>O Creator, let me not be burnt by communicating,
<br>For Thou art Fire which burns the unworthy.
<br>But purify me from every stain.

</p>
<p><span class="rubric">Then this Prayer:</span>
</p>
<p>Of Thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God, accept me today as a communicant;
for I will not speak of the Mystery to Thy enemies; I will not give Thee
a kiss like Judas; but like the Thief do I confess Thee. Remember me, O
Lord, in Thy Kingdom.

</p>
<p><span class="rubric">And again these lines:</span>

</p>
<p>Tremble, O man, when you see the deifying Blood,
<br>For it is a coal that burns the unworthy.
<br>The Body of God both deifies and nourishes;
<br>It deifies the spirit and wondrously nourishes the mind.


</p>
<p><span class="rubric">And these Troparia:</span>

</p>
<p>Thou hast ravished me with longing, O Christ, and with Thy divine love
Thou hast changed me. But burn up with spiritual fire my sins and make me
worthy to be filled with delight in Thee, that I may leap for joy, O gracious
Lord, and magnify Thy two comings.

</p>
<p>Into the splendor of Thy Saints how shall I who am unworthy enter? For
if I dare to enter the bridechamber, my vesture betrays me, for it is not
a wedding garment, and as a prisoner I shall be cast out by the Angels.
Cleanse my soul from pollution and save me, O Lord, in Thy love for men.

</p>
<p><span class="rubric">And this Prayer:</span>

</p>
<p>Sovereign Lover of men, Lord Jesus my God, let not these Holy Things
be to me for judgment through my being unworthy, but for the purification
and sanctification of my soul and body, and as a pledge of the life and
kingdom to come. For it is good for me to cling to God and to place in the Lord my hope of salvation.
