<p>Accept from us thy unworthy servants, O all-powerful for good, immaculate,
Sovereign Lady, Mother of God, these honorable gifts, which can be offered
only to thee, who art the one chosen out of all generations, and who hast
become higher than all creation, heavenly and earthly. For through thee
the Lord of Powers was with us, and through thee we came to know the Son
of God, and were granted His holy Body and most pure Blood. Therefore thou
art blessed by all generations, the Favourite of God, more radiant than
the Cherubim, and more honorable than the Seraphim. And now, O all-hymned,
most holy Mother of God, cease not to pray for us, thy unworthy servants,
to be delivered from every snare of the subtle one, and from all besetting
sins, and preserve us unharmed from every poisonous temptation of the devil.
But preserve us to the end uncondemned by thy prayers; for saved by thy
help and protection, we send up glory, praise, thanksgiving and adoration
for all, to the One God, in Trinity and Creator of all, now and ever, and
to the ages of ages. Amen.
